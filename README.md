### Moby Dick Teaches Typing

* During the 1950s, Hunter S. Thompson, typed out The Great Gatsby repeatedly
  in order to learn how to write The Great American Novel. This web app allows
  users to write out Moby Dick while they practice their typing
* Type the great American novel while you learn to type (and write)
* Goals of the project are to learn bacon.js and create something fun
  and useful
